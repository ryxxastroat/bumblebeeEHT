Example numerical solutions of spherical black holes in the bumblebee gravity model

**********These three DAT files are examples of the numerical solutions**********

Units: Geometrized (G=c=1) and the radius of the horizon taken as the unit length

First column: raidal coordinate 

Second column: g_{tt}

Third column: g_{rr}

Fourth column: b_t


**********specific parameters of each file**********

Coupling constant \xi = [0.8045, 1.811, 2.817]*8*\pi (as the names of the files suggest)

Mass of the solutions = [1.000, 1.000, 1.000] 

Bumblebee charge of the solutions = [1.186, 2.986, 4.447]



**********Code for calculating the solutions will be available after our current work is finished**********
